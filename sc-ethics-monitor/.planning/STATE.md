# SC Ethics Monitor - Current State

## Sprint Status

**Phase:** Simplified Structure Implemented
**Progress:** 100% complete
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-22

## Current Position

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Current Phase | Simplification Complete |
| Structure | 3 tabs (down from 5) |
| Candidates Columns | 9 (down from 16) |
| Race Analysis Columns | 6 (down from 11) |
| Status | Ready for production use |

## Simplified Structure (Implemented 2026-01-22)

### Problem Solved

The original 5-tab, 16-column structure was over-engineered:
- Complex party detection workflow (party_locked, manual_party_override, final_party)
- Research Queue and Sync Log tabs never used
- Formulas and dependencies causing confusion

### New 3-Tab Structure

| Tab | Purpose | Columns |
|-----|---------|---------|
| **Districts** | All 170 districts with incumbent info | 6 |
| **Candidates** | Filed candidates with party | 9 |
| **Race Analysis** | Computed district status | 6 |

### Candidates Tab (Simplified)

```
A: district_id       - e.g., "SC-House-042"
B: candidate_name    - Full name
C: party             - D/R/I/O (auto-detected, manually editable)
D: filed_date        - Date filed with Ethics
E: report_id         - Ethics filing ID
F: ethics_url        - HYPERLINK formula (clickable)
G: is_incumbent      - Yes/No
H: notes             - Optional user notes
I: last_synced       - Timestamp
```

**Key simplification:** Single `party` column. System writes auto-detected value, users can edit directly. No more party_locked, manual_party_override, final_party complexity.

### Race Analysis Tab (Simplified)

```
A: district_id         - e.g., "SC-House-042"
B: incumbent_name      - Current officeholder
C: incumbent_party     - D/R
D: challenger_count    - Number filed (excluding incumbent)
E: dem_filed           - Y/N
F: needs_dem_candidate - Y/N
```

Simple Y/N flags instead of complex priority scoring.

### Removed Tabs

| Tab | Reason |
|-----|--------|
| Research Queue | Overkill for 1-2 users |
| Sync Log | Not needed for small team |

## Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `src/config.py` | New column definitions (9 candidates, 6 race analysis) |
| `src/sheets_sync.py` | Simplified from ~1100 to ~640 lines |
| `src/monitor.py` | Simplified from 10-step to 6-step workflow |
| `scripts/export_to_webapp.py` | Updated for new column structure |
| `scripts/initialize_sheet.py` | 3-tab creation with migration support |
| `scripts/backup_sheet.py` | NEW - Backup current sheet before migration |

## User Workflow (Simplified)

1. **Daily**: GitHub Action syncs new filings automatically
2. **Check**: Open Google Sheet, view Candidates or Race Analysis tab
3. **Fix errors**: Edit `party` column directly if auto-detection was wrong
4. **Web app**: Updates automatically via export

No research queue. No locking. No confidence scores.

## Migration

To migrate from old 5-tab structure to new 3-tab structure:

```bash
# Backup current data first
python scripts/backup_sheet.py

# Initialize new structure (with migration)
python scripts/initialize_sheet.py --migrate --delete-legacy

# Or dry-run first
python scripts/initialize_sheet.py --migrate --delete-legacy --dry-run
```

## Previous Issues (Resolved)

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Race Analysis shows ALL ZEROS | Fixed - simplified to Y/N flags |
| 75% candidates have UNKNOWN party | Fixed - single party column, editable |
| Complex formulas | Fixed - removed, direct column editing |
| Google Sheet disconnected from web app | Fixed - export_to_webapp.py reads new structure |

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 6 added: Data Pipeline Integration - Connect Google Sheets to Web App
- Problem-Solving Diagnosis: Complexity spiraling + Assumption lock identified
- Root cause: final_party formula never applied to Candidates tab
